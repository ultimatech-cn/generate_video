# Wan22 for RunPod Serverless
[ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ README Î≥¥Í∏∞](README_kr.md)

This project is a template designed to easily deploy and use [Wan22](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged) in the RunPod Serverless environment.

[![Runpod](https://api.runpod.io/badge/wlsdml1114/generate_video)](https://console.runpod.io/hub/wlsdml1114/generate_video)

Wan22 is an advanced AI model that generates high-quality videos from images with natural motion and realistic animations.

## üé® Engui Studio Integration

[![EnguiStudio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wlsdml1114/Engui_Studio/main/assets/banner.png)](https://github.com/wlsdml1114/Engui_Studio)

This InfiniteTalk template is primarily designed for **Engui Studio**, a comprehensive AI model management platform. While it can be used via API, Engui Studio provides enhanced features and broader model support.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Image-to-Video Generation**: Converts static images into dynamic videos with natural motion.
*   **High-Quality Output**: Produces high-resolution videos with realistic animations.
*   **Customizable Parameters**: Control video generation with various parameters like seed, width, height, and prompts.
*   **ComfyUI Integration**: Built on top of ComfyUI for flexible workflow management.

## üöÄ RunPod Serverless Template

This template includes all the necessary components to run Wan22 as a RunPod Serverless Worker.

*   **Dockerfile**: Configures the environment and installs all dependencies required for model execution.
*   **handler.py**: Implements the handler function that processes requests for RunPod Serverless.
*   **entrypoint.sh**: Performs initialization tasks when the worker starts.
*   **new_Wan22_api.json**: Single workflow file supporting up to 4 LoRA pairs for image-to-video generation.

### Input

The `input` object must contain the following fields. Images can be input using **path, URL or Base64** - one method for each.

#### Image Input (use only one)
| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `image_path` | `string` | No | `/example_image.png` | Local path to the input image |

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage and API Reference

1.  Create a Serverless Endpoint on RunPod based on this repository.
2.  Once the build is complete and the endpoint is active, submit jobs via HTTP POST requests according to the API Reference below.

### üìÅ Using Network Volumes

Instead of directly transmitting Base64 encoded files, you can use RunPod's Network Volumes to handle large files. This is especially useful when dealing with large image files and LoRA models.

1.  **Create and Connect Network Volume**: Create a Network Volume (e.g., S3-based volume) from the RunPod dashboard and connect it to your Serverless Endpoint settings.
2.  **Upload Files**: Upload the image files and LoRA models you want to use to the created Network Volume.
3.  **File Organization**: 
    - Place your input images anywhere in the Network Volume
    - Place LoRA model files in the `/loras/` folder within the Network Volume
4.  **Specify Paths**: When making an API request, specify the file paths within the Network Volume:
    - For `image_path`: Use the full path to your image file (e.g., `"/my_volume/images/portrait.jpg"`)
    - For LoRA models: Use only the filename (e.g., `"my_lora_model.safetensors"`) - the system will automatically look in the `/loras/` folder

## üîß Workflow Configuration

This template uses a single workflow configuration:

*   **new_Wan22_api.json**: Image-to-video generation workflow (supports up to 4 LoRA pairs)

The workflow is based on ComfyUI and includes all necessary nodes for Wan22 processing:
- CLIP text encoding for prompts
- VAE loading and processing
- WanImageToVideo node for video generation
- LoRA loading and application nodes (WanVideoLoraSelectMulti)
- Image concatenation and processing nodes
